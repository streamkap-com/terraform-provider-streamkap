## Codebase Patterns
- The `docs/audits/` directory already exists with reference documentation files
- Go build command: `go build ./...` for typechecking
- Branch naming: PRD specifies `ralph/terraform-provider-audit` branch for audit work

## 2026-01-21 - US-001
- What was implemented:
  - Created `docs/audits/architecture-comparison-report.md` with proper structure
  - Added document header with title, date, auditor info
  - Added Table of Contents with 4 main sections
  - Added empty placeholder sections: Main Branch Architecture, Refactored Architecture, Comparison Matrix, Trade-offs
- Files changed:
  - Created: `docs/audits/architecture-comparison-report.md`
  - Created: `tasks/progress.txt`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The `docs/audits/` directory already existed with `backend-code-reference.md` and `entity-config-schema-audit.md`
  - These existing docs are useful references for understanding the backend and config schema
