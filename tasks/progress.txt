## Codebase Patterns
- The `docs/audits/` directory already exists with reference documentation files
- Go build command: `go build ./...` for typechecking
- Branch naming: PRD specifies `ralph/terraform-provider-audit` branch for audit work
- API client files are in `internal/api/`: auth.go (token), client.go (interface + doRequest), source.go, destination.go, etc.
- All API operations use `?secret_returned=true` to get sensitive fields in responses

- What was implemented:
  - Verified raw `database.hostname` computed field is NOT exposed in generated schemas (correct - only `database.hostname.user.defined` is exposed)
  - Verified raw `database.port` computed field is NOT exposed in generated schemas (correct - only `database.port.user.defined` is exposed)
  - Verified `connection.url` exclusion - Databricks uses `.user.defined`, Weaviate uses direct URL (intentional design)
  - Documented `IsUserDefined()` filter in parser that ensures only `user_defined: true` fields become Terraform attributes
  - Added field mapping statistics: 145 total `.user.defined` mappings across 38 generated files

  - Only fields with `user_defined: true` in backend config become Terraform attributes
  - `.user.defined` suffix in field name is stripped by `TerraformAttributeName()` to create clean attribute names
  - Not all fields have a computed counterpart - some fields (credentials, config options) are direct user inputs without `.user.defined` suffix
  - Transform resources don't use `.user.defined` pattern - they're configuration-only, not database connectors
