## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the transform

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `transforms_input_job_parallelism` (Number) The number of parallel tasks this transform should be using. Recommended: 1-5 for most workloads. Higher values increase throughput but consume more resources. Start low and increase based on lag metrics. Defaults to `5`.
- `transforms_input_serialization_format` (String) Format of the input topics Defaults to `Any`. Valid values: `Any`, `Avro`, `Json`.
- `transforms_input_topic_pattern` (String) Regex pattern to search for the input topics Defaults to `placeholder-input-topic-pattern-to-be-revised-during-implementation`.
- `transforms_language` (String) Language of the transform. Defaults to `SQL`. Valid values: `SQL`.
- `transforms_output_serialization_format` (String) Format of the output topics Defaults to `Any`. Valid values: `Any`, `Avro`, `Json`.
- `transforms_output_topic_pattern` (String) String pattern to save the output topics Defaults to `placeholder-output-replacement-pattern-to-be-revised-during-implementation`.
- `transforms_topic_ttl` (String) State TTL must be a valid duration like 3d, 10m, 2h, 30s Defaults to ``.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the transform
- `transform_type` (String) Transform type

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
