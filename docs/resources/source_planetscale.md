<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `database_hostname` (String) IP address or hostname of the PlanetScale database server (VTGate).
- `database_password` (String, Sensitive) Password of the PlanetScale database server (VTGate).

**Security:** This value is marked sensitive and will not appear in CLI output or logs.
- `database_user` (String) Username of the PlanetScale database server (VTGate).
- `name` (String) Name of the source
- `table_include_list` (String) Source tables to sync.
- `vitess_keyspace` (String) The name of the keyspace from which to stream the changes.

### Optional

- `column_exclude_list` (String) An optional, comma-separated list of regular expressions that match the fully-qualified names of columns that should be excluded from change event record values. Fully-qualified names for columns are of the form schemaName.tableName.columnName.
- `converter_tinyint_bool` (Boolean) Convert tinyInt(1) columns to boolean Defaults to `false`.
- `database_port` (Number) Integer port number of the PlanetScale database server (VTGate). Defaults to `443`.
- `schema_history_internal_store_only_captured_databases_ddl` (Boolean) Specifies whether the connector records schema structures from all logical databases in the database instance or only captured databases. Enabling this when you have many databases in your instance can improve performance and avoid timeouts. Defaults to `false`.
- `schema_history_internal_store_only_captured_tables_ddl` (Boolean) Specifies whether the connector records schema structures from all logical tables in the captured schemas or databases, or only captured tables. Enabling this when you have many tables can improve performance and avoid timeouts. Defaults to `false`.
- `ssh_enabled` (Boolean) Streamkap will connect to SSH server in your network which has access to your database. This is necessary if Streamkap cannot connect directly to your database. Defaults to `false`.
- `ssh_host` (String) Hostname of your SSH server
- `ssh_port` (Number) Port of your SSH server Defaults to `22`.
- `ssh_public_key` (String) Public key to add to SSH server Defaults to `<SSH.PUBLIC.KEY>`.
- `ssh_user` (String) User that allows Streamkap to connect to SSH server Defaults to `streamkap`.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `vitess_tablet_type` (String) The type of Tablet (hence MySQL) from which to stream the changes Defaults to `MASTER`. Valid values: `MASTER`, `REPLICA`, `RDONLY`.

### Read-Only

- `connector` (String) Connector type
- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the source

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Source PlanetScale can be imported by specifying the identifier.
terraform import streamkap_source_planetscale.example-source-planetscale 00000000000000000000000000
```
