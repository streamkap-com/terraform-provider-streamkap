### Optional

- `format` (String) The serialised format of the data written to the Kafka topic Defaults to `string`. Valid values: `json`, `string`.
- `schemas_enable` (Boolean) If untoggled (default), Streamkap attempts to infer schema from your data - depending on the Destination.

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
