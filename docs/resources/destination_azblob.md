<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `azblob_connection_string` (String, Sensitive) The connection string (for Account access keys) or Blob SAS URL (for Shared Access Signatures)

**Security:** This value is marked sensitive and will not appear in CLI output or logs.
- `name` (String) Name of the destination

### Optional

- `azblob_container_name` (String) The name of an existing blob container to use
- `compression` (String) The compression type to use when writing data to the storage.
- `file_name_template` (String) The format of the filename. See documentation for more information about formatting options. Defaults to `{{topic}}-{{partition}}-{{start_offset}}`.
- `file_size` (Number) Minimum size (in bytes) per file. Records are held in memory until this file size is met or the **Rotate interval** is exceeded Defaults to `65536`.
- `flush_size` (Number) Number of records to write per file Defaults to `1000`.
- `format` (String) The format to use when writing data to file storage Defaults to `json`. Valid values: `json`, `csv`, `avro`, `parquet`.
- `format_csv_write_headers` (Boolean) Include or exclude column name header row per file Defaults to `false`.
- `rotate_interval_ms` (Number) Maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait before writing records held in memory to file. This ignores the flush and file size settings Defaults to `-1`.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `topics_dir` (String) Top level directory for storing the data e.g. myfolder/subfolder

### Read-Only

- `connector` (String) Connector type
- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the destination

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Destination Azure Blob Storage can be imported by specifying the identifier.
terraform import streamkap_destination_azblob.example 00000000000000000000000000
```
