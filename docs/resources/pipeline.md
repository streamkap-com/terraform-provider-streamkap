# streamkap_pipeline (Resource)

Manages a **Streamkap pipeline** that connects sources to destinations with optional transforms.

A pipeline is the core orchestration resource that defines how data flows from a source connector through optional transforms to a destination connector.

## Schema

### Required

- `destination` (Object) Destination connector configuration block. Defines the destination connector that receives data from the pipeline.

**Nested attributes:**
- `id` - Destination connector identifier (from a `streamkap_destination_*` resource)
- `name` - Display name of the destination connector
- `connector` - Connector type code (e.g., `snowflake`, `clickhouse`) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--destination))
- `name` (String) Display name of the pipeline shown in the Streamkap UI.
- `source` (Object) Source connector configuration block. Defines the source connector that produces data for the pipeline.

**Nested attributes:**
- `id` - Source connector identifier (from a `streamkap_source_*` resource)
- `name` - Display name of the source connector
- `connector` - Connector type code (e.g., `postgresql`, `mysql`)
- `topics` - Set of topic names to consume from the source (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--source))

### Optional

- `snapshot_new_tables` (Boolean) Whether to automatically snapshot newly added tables (topics). When enabled, new tables added to the source will be automatically snapshotted. Defaults to `true`.
- `tags` (Set of String) Optional set of tag IDs to apply to the pipeline for organization and filtering in the Streamkap UI. Defaults to `["670e5ca40afe1d3983ce0c22"]`, which is the Streamkap system `Development` tag.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `transforms` (Attributes List) Optional list of transforms to apply to the pipeline data. Each transform processes data between the source and destination. Defaults to an empty list.

**Nested attributes:**
- `id` - Transform identifier (from a `streamkap_transform_*` resource)
- `topics` - Set of topic names that this transform should process (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--transforms))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the pipeline. Generated by Streamkap on creation.

<a id="nestedatt--destination"></a>
### Nested Schema for `destination`

Required:

- `connector` (String)
- `id` (String)
- `name` (String)


<a id="nestedatt--source"></a>
### Nested Schema for `source`

Required:

- `connector` (String)
- `id` (String)
- `name` (String)
- `topics` (Set of String)


<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).


<a id="nestedatt--transforms"></a>
### Nested Schema for `transforms`

Required:

- `id` (String) Transform identifier. References a transform resource (e.g., `streamkap_transform_mapfilter`, `streamkap_transform_enrich`).
- `topics` (Set of String) Set of topic names that this transform should process. Must be a subset of topics available from the source.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Destination Snowflake can be imported by specifying the identifier.
terraform import streamkap_pipeline.example-pipeline 665e894ebb3753f38d983cee
```
