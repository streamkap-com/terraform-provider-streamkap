## Schema

### Required

- `aws_redshift_domain` (String) Domain of the leader of the cluster
- `connection_password` (String, Sensitive) Password to access with the database

**Security:** This value is marked sensitive and will not appear in CLI output or logs.
- `connection_username` (String) Username to access the database
- `name` (String) Name of the destination
- `table_name_prefix` (String) Schema for the associated table name

### Optional

- `aws_redshift_database` (String) Name of the database on the cluster
- `aws_redshift_port` (Number) Port number for incoming connections to the leader Defaults to `5439`.
- `primary_key_fields` (String) List of comma-separated primary key field names Defaults to `id`.
- `schema_evolution` (String) Controls how schema evolution is handled by the sink connector. For pipelines with pre-created destination tables, set to `NONE` Defaults to `basic`. Valid values: `basic`, `none`.
- `tasks_max` (Number) The maximum number of active tasks Defaults to `5`.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `connector` (String) Connector type
- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the destination

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
